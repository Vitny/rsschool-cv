## About myself

With over 8 years of experience in technical support and IT systems implementation, I’ve built my career around helping teams use technology effectively. My journey began in retail and service industries, where I provided hands-on support, conducted staff training, and maintained internal knowledge bases.

Currently, I work as an IT support manager in a medical clinic, where I’m responsible for managing medical information systems (MIS), collecting feedback, documenting processes, and leading employee onboarding sessions. I’m actively involved in Agile-based project work, using tools like Kaiten, and regularly analyze new software solutions for internal use.

Alongside support roles, I also work with UI/UX design — creating mobile and web interfaces using Figma, conducting user flow analysis, and delivering pixel-perfect design solutions.

I’m looking for new challenges where I can apply my communication skills, technical background, and passion for improving user experience in a full-time or remote role.

## Skills:

- Javascript (Basic)
- HTML5, CSS3
- Git, GitHub
- VS Code
- Figma

## Code Example

```
alert("Hello, World!");
